# Source code for Matlab Software based Simulation of INEPT and JRES Spectra

## Article Information
***
* Insensitive Nuclear Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (INEPT) Spectroscopy is special type of Attached Proton Test techniques. It allow to detect number of protons attached to a carbon inform of dispersive multiplets.
* J-resolved (JRES) NMR Spectroscopy allows to resolve 1D proton NMR Spectra into a 2D 1H-1H NMR Spectra having chemical shift in f2 axis and coupling constants in f1 axis.

## About this repository
***
This repository provides Matlab codes to run pulse sequence on spin hamiltonians. INEPT pulse sequence applied on two spins system. JRES pulse sequence applied on three spins. The repository contain files:

* Twospins.m
* INEPT SIM.m
* JRES SIM.m
* INEPT Spectra.tif
* JRES Spectra.tif

Additional file required are: diprod.m, pauli.m, thrspins.m. These files are available on T. S. Mahesh (2002) research work. URL: "https://www.oocities.org/tsm3nmr/research/nmr/mywork/mat/mat.html"
